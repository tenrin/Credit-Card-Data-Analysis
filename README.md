# Credit Card Data Analysis

This project is for analyzing and categorizing credit card transactions extracted from PDF files. Using Python, it processes multiple PDF statements, extracts transaction details, and organizes them for further analysis.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the raw PDF files with credit card statements.
- `scripts/`: Holds the Python scripts for data extraction and preprocessing.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for interactive data exploration and visualization.
- `output/`: Contains processed data files and results.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Credit-Card-Data-Analysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Credit-Card-Data-Analysis
   ```
3. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Place your PDF files in the `data/` directory.
2. Run the `extract_data.py` script to process and parse the files.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Add code for categorizing transactions
- [ ] Implement data visualization for transaction insights
- [ ] Build a web-based user interface (future plan)
